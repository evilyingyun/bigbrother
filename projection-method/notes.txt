VIDEO OFFSET: VIDEO A IS 310-315 FRAMES AHEAD OF VIDEO B
e.g. python3 trim.py ../clips/aligned/horizontal.MP4 --dest ../data_thebigone --start 10 --height 1000 --trace --vertical ../clips/aligned/vertical.MP4 --offset -310

Use --angle 45 0 270

Order:
0 - 1

14 - 1

Times to draw (seconds):
1 - 0.5
0 - 0.433
8 - 0.73

.4 to 1 second (for our test data)
Practically, probably .3 to 1 seconds

Potential sources of problems: 

- wrong angles?
- not enough data
- distance function - (x + y)^2 bad?
- tracking noise - bad motion tracking?
- normalization destroying notion of size differences / scale


PLANS FOR IMPROVEMENT
- Record up / down motion in ground truth data, for use in projection
- Find a definitive way to get the right angles instead of having to guess
- Take more data
- Look into using X and Y relative scale instead of just normalizing everything
- Look into using different distance metrics
- Look into using time as a reference
- Investigate using different resolutions / framerates / positions that simplify the security model
